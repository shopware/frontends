# Register synchronized types

The last step is to let the _API Client_ know which types to use. To achieve this, we are going to change a bit a way how we create an _API Client_ instance.

Thanks to this step, the _API Client_ will be aware of the types coming from the Shopware 6 instance you are using.

## Point the custom types

```ts add={5} del={3}
import { createAPIClient } from "@shopware/api-client";
// You can pick types of your current API version, the default one:
import type { operations } from "@shopware/api-client/store-api-types";
// or - RECOMMENDED - your types generated by [@shopware/api-gen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopware/api-gen) CLI:
import type { operations } from "./api-types/storeApiTypes";

export async function setupExample() {
  const shopwareEndpoint = "https://demo-frontends.shopware.store/store-api";
  const accessToken = "SWSCBHFSNTVMAWNZDNFKSHLAYW";

  const apiClient = createAPIClient<operations>({
    baseURL: shopwareEndpoint,
    accessToken: accessToken,
  });
}
```

## The current state

Great! you did it!

Since now, you are able to:

- See and use the types of entities present on your backend (see `./api-types/storeApiTypes.d.ts` from previous lesson):

```ts
import type { Schemas } from "./api-types/storeApiTypes";

const product: Schemas["Product"] = {
  name: "My Product",
  // ...
};
```

- Make a call to the endpoints defined as operations in your backend (via `invoke` method of _Client_ instance):

```ts
apiClient.invoke("addLineItem post /checkout/cart/line-item", {
  body: {
    items: [
      {
        id: "SWAG-1",
        referencedId: "SWAG-1",
        quantity: 1,
        type: "product",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
