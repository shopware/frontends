Add horizontal filter layout for product listings. When the sidebar filter element is placed outside a sidebar section, filters now display as horizontal dropdowns.

Includes new `SwFilterDropdown` and `SwProductListingFiltersHorizontal` components, with a `displayMode` prop added to all filter components to support both layouts.
