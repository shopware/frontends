Enhanced the `useSyncWishlist` composable by exposing the `limit`, `productsSync`, and `isLoading` properties, allowing better control and monitoring of the wishlist state. Similarly, updated `useWishlist` to also expose `limit`, `productsSync`, and `isLoading` properties for both local and synced wishlists, providing a consistent API and improved state handling for wishlist management.
