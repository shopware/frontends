# Customize Components

:::info Only for `cms-base` package
The directory structure is only relevant, if you want to customize the components of the `cms-base` package. If you are using a custom template, you can place components where you want, because you handle their resolution by yourself. In that case skip to [Create Elements](./create-elements).
:::

### Create new files

In order to customize a component, you need to override it. The process is the same regardless what type of component you want to override

- Sections
- Blocks
- Elements

To do so, you need to create a file with the same name as the component in the `components` directory or wherever according to the project's configuration.

```json
demo-store/
├─ components/
|  ├─ cms/
|  ├─ ├─ CmsBlockImageHighlightRow.vue
```

Now the CMS module will automatically resolve that file based on the name and you can start writing your component.

## Internal components

❗**Internal components are not a part of public API. Once overwritten you need to track the changes on your own.**

There is also a possibility to override the internal components, shared between public blocks and elements, the ones starting with `Sw` prefix, like [SwSlider.vue](https://github.com/shopware/frontends/blob/main/packages/cms-base/components/SwSlider.vue) or [SwProductCard.vue](https://github.com/shopware/frontends/blob/main/packages/cms-base/components/SwProductCard.vue).
