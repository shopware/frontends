# Overwrite CMS blocks in Nuxt 3 app

To override CMS blocks in the Nuxt 3 app, create a `.vue` file with the cms block name in the components directory.
Because of auto importing, CMS component import will be overwritten by the new file path.

More about auto imports can be found [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports)

## Example how to overwrite the product card

We have this cms product card **component** from **cms-base package**:  
`packages/cms-base/components/SwProductCard.vue`

If we want to create our own product card **component** in **demo-store** the correct place would be:
`templates/vue-demo-store/components/cms/SwProductCard.vue`

### Resolving folder structure

**Nuxt** is resolving names by folder structure, so if you have:  
`/components/public/some/name.vue`  
then component name is **PublicSomeName**.

You can repeat folder structure in name like:  
`/components/cms/Name.vue`  
`/components/cms/CmsName.vue`

These are the same components resolving as **CmsName**. ðŸ’¡

### Generic CMS components

Generic components are responsible for resolving each CMS element

- [CmsGenericElement.vue](https://github.com/shopware/frontends/blob/main/packages/cms-base/components/public/cms/CmsGenericElement.vue)
- [CmsGenericBlock.vue](https://github.com/shopware/frontends/blob/main/packages/cms-base/components/public/cms/CmsGenericBlock.vue)
