# Sitemap

Link:

```
http://<your_domain>/sitemap.xml
```

## Backend sitemap

```
/server/routes/sitemap.xml.ts
```

This sitemap contains links to pages like:

- Product pages
- Category pages
- CMS pages

More about backend sitemap can be found [here](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/sitemap)

## Frontends sitemap

```

```

This sitemap contains static page that are declared in the Frontends app

Each static page that comes from the Frontneds app, should be added manually to the `/server/sitemap.ts` file.
