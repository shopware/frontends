Shopware Frontends is Shopware's Vue.js <strong>framework</strong> for building custom storefronts.

## How it works

Frontends is a collection of multiple packages that you can use to implement your custom storefront project.

### Data Sources

Shopware 6 is considered one "supported" data source, but you can integrate any other data source you like - such as CMS or analytics. Shopware Frontends uses the Store API to connect with your Shopware 6 instance at runtime.

### Logic

A big part (and a risk factor) of every custom storefront project is the implementation of domain-specific business functionality. That's why Shopware Frontends offers various packages that take care of some heavy lifting:

- Routing
- Shopping worlds (Shopware CMS) integration
- Product searches and filters
- Price formatting
- Authentication & state handling

It also comes with TypeScript support.

### Template / UI

You can decide to start from scratch and use no template at all, but we recommend looking at our [Templates](./getting-started/templates.md) which are based on **Nuxt.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
