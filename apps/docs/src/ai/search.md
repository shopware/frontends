# Documentation assistant (QA)

Please **ask your question** and I will do my best to guide you to the correct resource. I use **AI** to score the best answer in our documentation.

If my answer is correct, please give a **thumbs up** to help improve the **language model**. We are currently using the `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` language model, but it can be switched to `openai` or other models supported by Hugging Face.

Try it out, just ask a question:
