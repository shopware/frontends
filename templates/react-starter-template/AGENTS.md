# react-starter-template

Next.js App Router storefront template for Shopware 6, the React counterpart of
`vue-starter-template`. State: anonymous Store API reads, SEO URL routing, CMS
rendering, the header/footer layout and a browser session with login,
registration and logout work; cart, wishlist, search and forms are stubs.
`supportLevel` in `templates/manifest.json` is authoritative.

## Next.js docs

Next.js ships docs that match the installed version in
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Read the relevant guide there before writing
Next.js code: 16.3 differs from most training data (Cache Components,
`proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`, async request APIs).

`agentRules` is `false` in `next.config.ts`, so `next dev` does not write its
own `AGENTS.md` block or a `CLAUDE.md` pointer file. The repository keeps
`AGENTS.md` files only.

## Store API

- Server clients come only from `platform/shopware/client.ts`
  (`createShopwareClient`), and every module there imports `server-only`
  except `publicConfig.ts` and `reads/countryOptions.ts`. The one browser
  client is `features/session/browserClient.ts` (see Session and actions).
  The config is read on the server at request time (`getShopwareConfig`:
  `SHOPWARE_ENDPOINT`, `SHOPWARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SHOPWARE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`,
  `SHOPWARE_DEV_STOREFRONT_URL`) and falls back to the public demo backend,
  like the Vue starter's `nuxt.config.ts` defaults. Server reads use
  `endpoint`; `publicEndpoint` (defaults to `endpoint`) is what the browser
  calls, for setups where the server reaches Shopware on an internal URL.
  `.env.template` leaves `SHOPWARE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` and
  `SHOPWARE_DEV_STOREFRONT_URL` empty on purpose: a demo value left there
  after `SHOPWARE_ENDPOINT` is re-pointed sends the shop's logins and
  registrations to the demo host. `getShopwareConfig` warns once per process
  when that happens.
- Create one server client per request, never at module scope. An instance
  adopts the `sw-context-token` of every response, so a shared one leaks
  sessions between users.
- Reads live in `platform/shopware/reads/`. Each is a `'use cache'` function
  that creates its own anonymous client and sets a `cacheLife` profile from
  `next.config.ts` (`catalog`, `listing`, `seo`, `reference`) and an `sw:` tag.
  When an endpoint has a GET variant (an `operations` key of the form
  `<operationId>Get get <path>`), the read uses it and sends its criteria as
  `query: { _criteria: encodeForQuery(criteria) }`. POST is only for endpoints
  without one. Unlike the Vue composables there is no `cacheableReads` switch
  and no POST fallback. Where the generated GET type does not declare
  `_criteria` yet (category, landing page), the read widens the query type
  locally, the precedent being `useCategorySearch.search` in composables.
  Let a failed read throw so the failure is not cached; the calling
  component handles it (`notFoundOn404` in `platform/shopware/errors.ts`).
- The Store API caps `limit` at 100 and the demo backend has 250 countries, so
  `readCountries` pages through `/country` with `"total-count-mode": "exact"`
  until `elements.length >= total` (ten pages at most) and returns
  `CountryOption`s. The sort is `position`, then `name`, then `id`: most
  countries share one position, and paging on a non-unique sort returns the
  same country on several pages (153 unique out of 250 on the demo). The mapping and the per-page criteria sit in
  `reads/countryOptions.ts` without `server-only`, so client islands and tests
  can import the type and the pure helpers.
- Import Store API types from `#shopware` (`shopware.d.ts`) with `import type`
  only. Point that file at `./api-types/storeApiTypes` after running
  `loadSchema` and `generate-types` to get the types of your own instance.

## Routing and CMS

- `app/[...path]/page.tsx` resolves every storefront URL in a server
  component: `/` maps to the sales channel's navigation category, technical
  paths (`/navigation/{id}`, `/detail/{id}`, `/landingPage/{id}`) are parsed
  with `getRouteFromPathInfo`, everything else is looked up in `/seo-url` with
  both the plain path and the path with a trailing slash. The result is
  dispatched to `features/cms/components/{NavigationPage,DetailPage,LandingPage}`.
- A miss calls `notFound()` inside a `<Suspense>` boundary, which streams a
  200 with `noindex`, not a real 404. Real 301/404/503 status codes need the
  lookup in `proxy.ts`; that is a later stage, do not try to fix it in the
  page.
- `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` is on because Shopware category paths end with
  `/`. The catch-all receives the segments without that slash, which is why
  the SEO lookup tries both spellings.
- CMS pages render through `@shopware/cms-base-layer-react`: `CmsPage` with a
  `CmsContext` built by `platform/cms/context.ts` (`createStorefrontCmsContext`,
  locale `en-GB`, currency from `/context`). Override a CMS component in
  `platform/cms/registry.ts` with `mergeCmsRegistries`, never by editing the
  package. `app/globals.css` imports the package stylesheet and adds `@source`
  for its `src`, otherwise Tailwind drops the component classes.
- Listing state lives in the URL (`manufacturer`, `properties`, `min-price`,
  `max-price`, `rating`, `shipping-free`, `order`, `limit`, `p`). When those
  params are present and the category layout contains a product listing,
  `NavigationPage` re-reads `/product-listing/{categoryId}` with them and
  passes the result as `ctx.listing`; otherwise the listing embedded in the
  CMS data is used.
- Reading `searchParams` or calling `connection()` makes a subtree dynamic, so
  it always happens inside a `<Suspense>` (`PageSkeleton` is the fallback).
  Catalog routes must never read `cookies()` or `headers()`.
- The home page calls `connection()` before its reads so `next build` does
  not need the Store API. Prerendering at build time is a later decision.

## Layout

- `app/layout.tsx` renders `features/layout/components/Header` and `Footer`
  around `<main aria-label="Main content">`. Both are server components. The
  parts that read the Store API (`readNavigation("main-navigation", 2)` for
  the header, `"footer-navigation"` with depth 1 for the footer) await
  `connection()` inside their own `<Suspense>`, so the hermetic build works
  and the header bar renders before the navigation streams in. The two header
  readers share one `cache()`d loader.
- Categories cross into client islands only as `NavigationNode` trees
  (`features/navigation/navigationTree.ts`: id, name, href from
  `getCategoryUrl`, `external` for `externalLink`/`linkNewTab`, children).
  `NavigationLink` turns `external` into `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.
  Never pass `Schemas["Category"]` to a client component.
- Client islands: `TopNavigation` (desktop menubar with the flyout, hidden
  below `lg`), `MobileMenu` (burger plus a `<dialog>` drawer with
  `data-testid="sidebar-left"`, focus trap and body scroll lock), `HeaderBar`
  (logo, search, account/wishlist/cart buttons, mobile search toggle),
  `HeaderSearch` and `NewsletterBox`.
- Session data comes from `useSession()` in `features/session`, filled in the
  browser by `ShopwareSessionProvider` (see Session and actions). The account
  button sends a guest to `/account/login?redirect=<encoded path>` like the
  Vue header's `route.fullPath`, and `LoginForm` and `RegistrationForm`
  follow that `redirect` after a login or a registration.
  They read `window.location` in the event handler, never `usePathname()` or
  `useSearchParams()` during render: with Cache Components those hooks suspend
  the root layout under `app/[...path]` (an unknown catch-all param), which
  fails `next build`, and would drop the login form out of the static shell.
  `AccountMenu` may call `usePathname()` only because it renders after a
  click, never on the server.
- Logged in, the account button is a disclosure (`aria-expanded`,
  `aria-controls`) for `AccountMenu`: the "Signed in as" line and Logout. It
  closes on Escape, an outside `mousedown`, a route change and a logout.
  With status `"error"` the click is not a guest click: it awaits
  `retrySession()` (the button is `aria-busy` meanwhile) and opens the menu or
  goes to the login page depending on the session it returns.
  `LoggedInRedirect` on `/account/login` decides once, on the first status
  that is not `"loading"`, and replaces to the redirect target only for a
  customer who arrived logged in; a login or registration on the page
  navigates from the form. Both resolve the same target
  (`resolveRedirectFromSearch`, which returns the URL-normalized path and
  refuses any whose normalized pathname starts with `//`, such as
  `/.//evil.example`), so a login during the first session read,
  which can trigger both, still lands on one URL.
- The wishlist and cart buttons and the search input only call `notify()`
  with the messages in `features/storefront/notWired.ts`; the newsletter form
  goes through `subscribeNewsletter` of the actions port, so wiring it later
  needs no form change.
- UI copy sits in a `t` const at the top of each component, keyed by the Vue
  i18n keys (`templates/vue-starter-template/i18n/en-GB/*.json`), ready for a
  next-intl swap. Keep the Vue `data-testid`s and roles
  (`header-account-button[data-logged-in]`, `header-wishlist-button`,
  `header-mini-cart-button`, `header-search-input`,
  `[role="menubar"] [role="menuitem"]` for top-level entries only); the e2e
  suite asserts them.
- Icons are hand-ported meteor SVGs in `components/icons/index.tsx` (fill
  `currentColor`, `aria-hidden`). Shared class lists live in
  `components/input.ts` and `features/layout/headerAction.ts`.
- `pnpm --filter react-starter-template test` runs two Vitest projects:
  `*.test.{ts,tsx}` in node (SSR markup through `test/render.tsx`) and
  `*.dom.test.tsx` in happy-dom for the interactive contract (drawer,
  flyout). Components that import `server-only` or call `connection()` are
  not rendered in tests.

## Session and actions

- The session lives in the browser, like `packages/nuxt-module/plugin.ts`:
  `features/session/browserClient.ts` creates the browser `@shopware/api-client`
  instance (`createBrowserClient`) with the context token from the
  JS-readable `sw-context-token` cookie, and an `onContextChanged` hook writes
  every new token back with `js-cookie`: 365 days, path `/`, `sameSite: "lax"`,
  `secure` when the page itself is served over `https:`. Nuxt keys `secure` on
  the endpoint protocol instead, but the cookie belongs to the page, so the
  page protocol is what counts. The module never imports a `server-only` file.
- Server rendering stays anonymous. Reads in `platform/shopware/reads/` create
  anonymous clients and never read `cookies()` or `headers()`, so the catalog
  stays static and cached: reading the cookie would move catalog routes to
  request-time rendering, and personalized catalog HTML must never be cached
  and shared. Anything personal is read in the browser after hydration;
  `StorefrontSession.status` is `"loading"` until then.
- The browser gets the endpoint, the access token and `devStorefrontUrl` from
  the route handler `app/api/shopware/config/route.ts` (`GET`, `connection()`
  first, `Cache-Control: no-store`), never from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`: those are
  inlined at build time, so one build could not be re-pointed at another
  instance. The static `api` segment wins over `app/[...path]`.
  `loadPublicConfig` fetches it once per page load and forgets a failure, so
  the next caller retries; `parsePublicShopwareConfig` in
  `platform/shopware/publicConfig.ts` validates the payload. That fetch and
  the `/context` read give up after `READ_TIMEOUT_MS`
  (`features/session/readTimeout.ts`; ofetch retries the read once), because
  every action waits for them. Mutations have no timeout.
- `features/session/components/ShopwareSessionProvider.tsx`, mounted by
  `StorefrontProviders`, binds one `createSessionStore()`
  (`features/session/sessionStore.ts`) with `useSyncExternalStore`; the
  server snapshot is `anonymousSession`. The store creates the client once
  (also under StrictMode), reads `/context`, ignores a read that a newer one
  overtook, and derives the `StorefrontSession` (`sessionFromContext.ts`:
  `isLoggedIn` exactly like `useUser`, an active customer that is not a
  guest). A failed read gives status `"error"` and a logged-out session,
  logged to the console without a toast. Only a successful first read is
  memoized, so after a failure the next action reads `/context` again before
  it runs. While the status is `"error"` the provider re-reads on `online`
  and on `visibilitychange` to a visible tab, and `retrySession()` on the
  actions port re-reads and resolves the new session (it never rejects).
  Cart and wishlist counts stay 0.
- Login, registration and logout go through the session actions port
  (`features/session/components/SessionActionsContext.tsx`:
  `SessionActionsProvider`, `useSessionActions`), implemented by
  `createSessionActions` in `features/session/sessionActions.ts`: the Store
  API call, then a `/context` re-read, mirroring `useUser`. The forms send
  the real payload (`RegistrationInput` is the `/account/register` body
  without `storefrontUrl`); `register` adds `storefrontUrl` from
  `storefrontUrl.ts`, a port of `getStorefrontUrl`
  (`devStorefrontUrl`, else the page origin, matched against the sales
  channel domains), resolved after the client and its config are ready.
  A logout rejected with 403 `FRAMEWORK__ROUTING_CUSTOMER_NOT_LOGGED_IN`
  means the session already ended (another tab, an expired context), so it
  refreshes the session and resolves `{ ok: true }` without a toast; every
  other logout failure stays a failure. Actions called before the client is
  ready wait for it and for the first `/context` read, so a late guest token
  cannot overwrite the login token. A failed re-read after a successful
  mutation does not turn it into a failure.
- The actions never reject. On an error they resolve every message with
  `resolveApiErrorMessages` (`apiErrors.ts`, a port of the Vue
  `useApiErrorsResolver` with the copy of `errors.json` in
  `errorMessages.ts`), show one error toast per message themselves and
  resolve `{ ok: false, message }` with the first one, so the forms must not
  notify `{ ok: false }` again. Anything that is not an `ApiClientError`
  resolves to `errors.message-default`.
- `StorefrontProviders` is also the app side of the CMS actions port
  (`CmsActionsProvider`). Cart, wishlist, variant lookup and forms are
  still stubs there that show a "not connected" notification
  (`features/storefront/notWired.ts`) and return `{ ok: false }`. Wire them
  there, not in the CMS components.

## Rules the code does not show

- Colors come from `@shopware/design-tokens` (`tailwind.css`, `@theme static`).
  The class names match the Vue templates (`bg-brand-primary`,
  `text-surface-on-surface`), so markup ports between them. Add or change a
  color in that package, not here.
- The template reads `@shopware/design-tokens` from its build output, and
  `unbuild --stub` does not work in Next.js client bundles. After changing the
  package, rebuild it: `pnpm --filter @shopware/design-tokens build`.
  `@shopware/cms-base-layer-react` ships source, so its edits are live.
- `@shopware/design-tokens` and `@shopware/cms-base-layer-react` are linked
  with `workspace:*` until they are published, which is why the template is
  not scaffoldable yet.
